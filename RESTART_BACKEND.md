## Restarting the backend server

If you make changes to any files under the `backend/` folder (routes, configs, jobs, etc.), restart the Node server so the changes take effect:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

If a server is already running, stop it (Ctrl+C in the terminal) and run `npm start` again.
