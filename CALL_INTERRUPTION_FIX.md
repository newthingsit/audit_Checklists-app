# Phone Call Interruption Fix - Testing Guide

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: When auditors receive phone calls during audits, all checklist responses are lost and the audit restarts from the beginning.

**Root Cause**: App had no AppState listener to detect when going to background, causing unsaved progress to be lost.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic background save that triggers whenever the app is interrupted (calls, home button, etc.)

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AppState Listener

- Monitors app state changes (active ↔ background)
- Automatically triggers save when app goes to background
- Works for: Phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp calls, home button, app switcher

### 2. Dual Save Strategy

- **Local Save**: Always saves to AsyncStorage (instant, works offline)
- **Server Sync**: Syncs to server if online (backup, accessible across devices)

### 3. Auto-Recovery

- Progress automatically restored when returning to app
- Works with existing auto-save (every 60 seconds)
- No user action required

---

## How It Works

```text
User conducting audit
    ↓
Phone call received → App goes to background
    ↓
AppState listener detects "background" state
    ↓
Automatically saves:
    - All checklist responses
    - Comments
    - Photos
    - Selected options
    - Multiple selections
    - Category completion status
    - Current step/category
    - Attendees & points discussed
    - Location data
    ↓
User finishes call → Returns to app
    ↓
App automatically restores progress
    ↓
User continues from where they left off ✅
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Phone Call Interruption

1. **Start an audit** on mobile app
2. **Fill in responses** for at least 5-10 items
3. **Add comments** and **photos** to some items
4. **Receive or make a phone call**
5. **Talk for 1-2 minutes**
6. **Return to app**
7. **VERIFY**: All responses, comments, and photos are still there ✅

### Test 2: Home Button Test

1. **Start audit** and fill responses
2. **Press home button** (app goes to background)
3. **Wait 30 seconds**
4. **Open app again**
5. **VERIFY**: Progress restored ✅

### Test 3: App Switcher Test

1. **Start audit** and fill responses
2. **Open app switcher** (recent apps)
3. **Switch to another app** for 1-2 minutes
4. **Return to audit app**
5. **VERIFY**: All data intact ✅

### Test 4: Multiple Interruptions

1. **Start audit** with responses
2. **Interrupt with call** → Return
3. **Add more responses**
4. **Interrupt with home button** → Return
5. **Add more responses**
6. **Interrupt with app switcher** → Return
7. **VERIFY**: All data accumulated correctly ✅

### Test 5: Offline + Call

1. **Turn off WiFi/mobile data**
2. **Start audit** and add responses
3. **Receive phone call**
4. **Return to app**
5. **VERIFY**: Offline save worked (local AsyncStorage) ✅
6. **Turn on connectivity**
7. **VERIFY**: Data syncs to server ✅

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Indicators

- No data loss when receiving calls
- Audit continues from exact point where interrupted
- All responses, comments, photos preserved
- Works offline and online
- No "start from beginning" scenario
- Console logs show: `[AppState] ✅ Audit progress saved successfully before going to background`

### ❌ Failure Indicators

- Responses disappear after call
- Audit resets to beginning
- Comments/photos lost
- Error messages in console
- "Draft not found" messages

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- [mobile/src/screens/AuditFormScreen.js](mobile/src/screens/AuditFormScreen.js)

### Key Changes

1. Added `AppState` import from `react-native`
2. Added `useEffect` hook with AppState listener
3. Saves on `background` and `inactive` states
4. Cleanup on component unmount

### Save Trigger Points

1. **Every 60 seconds** (existing auto-save)
2. **Manual "Save Draft" button**
3. **When app goes to background** (NEW ✅)
4. **When app becomes inactive** (NEW ✅)

### Console Logs to Watch

```text
[AppState] App going to background - saving audit progress...
[AppState] ✅ Audit progress saved successfully before going to background
[AppState] ✅ Audit synced to server before background (if online)
[AppState] App returned to foreground
```

## Deployment

### To Deploy Fix

1. **Already pushed** to master branch ✅
2. **Build new APK** with GitHub Actions or EAS
3. **Test with new build**
4. **Distribute to auditors**

### Build Command

```bash
# Via GitHub Actions (recommended)
Go to: https://github.com/newthingsit/audit_Checklists-app/actions
Run: "Build Android Release APK" workflow on master branch

# Or via local WSL/EAS
cd mobile
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Monitoring

### After Deployment - Check

1. **User feedback**: "Do audits still reset after calls?"
2. **Console logs**: Look for AppState save messages
3. **Server logs**: Check for draft saves with `savedOnBackground: true`
4. **AsyncStorage**: Verify local saves are working

### Success Metrics

- Zero reports of "audit reset after call"
- Increased audit completion rates
- Fewer abandoned audits
- Positive auditor feedback
